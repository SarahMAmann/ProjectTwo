[Bands Overload](https://bandsoverload-live1.herokuapp.com) is a Spotify music review blog. The application uses Facebook User Authentication to require a user to be logged in before they can create a new review. Once logged in, the user can enter their favorite genre, artist, and song and select "search" to display data from the Spotify API including album artwork and a link to preview the song if one is available. The information the user entered is stored in a mySQL database, and a new genre category is created for their entry and displayed on the homepage. The user can then add a new post reviewing that song, which will also be displayed on the homepage in order of the most recently added.
